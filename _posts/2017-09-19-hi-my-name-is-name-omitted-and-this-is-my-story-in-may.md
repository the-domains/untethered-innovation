  "Hi, my name is [name omitted] and this is my story: In May of 2017 I began to
  experience an episode of what is commonly known and talked abouttoday as
  severe anxiety and panic attacks. But what is not commonly known but soon will
  be is the method by which I gained relief from it.  Like most people I went
  first to see a psychologist and after what seemed like an eternity of
  preamble, I was eventually prescribed some mental 'strategies' to 'cope with'
  and 'manage' the horror I was experiencing. And no doubt these strategies work
  as far as 'coping with' goes. But I was not seeking coping mechanisms, which
  is really just treating symptoms - a form 'anesthesia' if you like. I wanted
  to be fully well again and to understand the root causes of my malady.  In my
  desperation I turned to my friend Christopher McHugh whom I knew as a
  philosopher of sorts. And to my astonishment he had just developed a new
  theory regarding psychological disorders that has been named 'Loop Analysis'.
  Put simply, I was in an unending loop of fear and defense against the things I
  was afraid of. A kind of 'hellish prison' of anxiety. And the only way to true
  healing and not just coping was to break out of it.  This requires a kind of
  analysis that anyone could be easily guided through and I will attest to the
  fact by my own experience that it is quick and effective. In minutes I had
  gained genuine insight into what was causing my anxiety and was well on the
  way to true healing.  If you are suffering from anxiety or any similar problem
  do not hesitate to undergo a 'loop analysis' - you will not be disappointed."
