  A seemingly prevalent belief of why many struggle to attain a satisfactory
  relationship is that there are relatively few "goodmen" or "good women" in the
  world. Indeed, it is sometimes assumed unquestioningly. I'm inclined to
  disagree.  Most issues in the dating world seem not to be the result of
  intrinsic faults of the people involved, but of the nature of the culture
  which suppresses authentic relationships in several ways. For instance:  1.
  Being single is stigmatized, which in many creates a desire to want a
  relationship with someone out of a "lack" in themselves.  2. People very often
  speak in what they're "looking for" in a prospective future love interest, in
  ways that would seemingly lead many to, when interacting with someone of the
  opposite gender, deal with the person as they want them to be (whether they
  "check all the boxes") rather than as they are.  3. Men who would pursue women
  are often exposed to concepts such as "leagues" that could discourage them
  from pursuing a woman they truly want, and/or encourage them to pursue a woman
  they don't really want. Rejection is inevitably going to hurt, but it seems
  those men who are rejected are often made fun of unnecessarily, artificially
  adding to the hesitation to pursue a woman. Women pursuing men is largely
  discouraged entirely.  4. When a relationship is formed, there are so many
  "shoulds" and demand structures around relationships that it can seemingly
  lead someone to not receive the other, but to try to be like others want them
  to be, or like what one thinks their love interest wants them to be.  5. Such
  a widespread belief in the rarity of "good men" or "good women" would seem to
  influence someone to always have a nagging pessimism about their love
  interest, which could lead them to "hold back" their gift to them to
  anticipate a potential heart break.  6. Relationships seem to be seen by many
  as a kind of battle of wills, where the goal is to get what one wants.
  Conflicts are seen as having a "winner" and a "loser", instead of as either
  having two winners or two losers depending on whether it is resolved in a way
  that is satisfying to both parties, and is good for the relationship.  7.
  Actions are often taken in "defense" against possible harm to a
  relationship/loss of a love interest, in such a way that the person(s)
  involved aren't really being received as a good. When left unchecked, this is
  the kind of thing that leads to abusive relationships, but is seemingly
  considered romantic by many.  8. When heartbreak happens, it seems that many
  fall deeper into one or more of the above errors.  All of the above are
  contrary to an authentic relationship, where both parties receive the other as
  a gift, and don't block either that receptivity or their gift to the other in
  anticipation of heartbreak.  So in conclusion, I don't think the problem is
  that there aren't enough good men or good women. There are plenty of good men
  or good women- they have difficulty forming good relationships because the
  culture puts a million roadblocks in the way of one.
