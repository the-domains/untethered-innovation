  That interpersonal communication is logically necessary.


  We've proven that whatever is compatible with (i.e. not logically excluded by)
  every/any contingent situation (or fact set, if you prefer) whatsoever is
  logically necessary. Recalling the proof:


  1) If it is not the case that x is necessary, then it is not the case that x
  is compatible with every contingency. [by definition of "necessary" there is
  some possible situation which dis-includes whatever is non-necessary]


  2) If x is compatible with every contingency, then x is necessary. [From 1,
  Contraposition]


  Observe, though, that propositions (as such) are logically compatible with
  every contingent situation. Namely, there being some true proposition(s) about
  a situation does not/cannot logically exclude/displace any positive aspects of
  the situation as it stands, but relies on the positive facts being the case in
  order to express those facts.


  Observe, further, that "being known" and "being said" and "being said from one
  person to another" are properties compatible with (i.e. not possibly logically
  excluded by) any given well-formed true proposition.


  But that means a "knower" is compatible with every contingent situation if
  propositions (as such) are, and therefore a knower is logically necessary,
  since whatever is compatible with every contingent situation is necessary.


  It also means "interpersonal communication" is logically
  necessary.                 About Us  (developed a way of seeing life and
