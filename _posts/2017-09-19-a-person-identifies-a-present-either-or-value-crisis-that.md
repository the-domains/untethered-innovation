  A person identifies a present "either or" value crisis that they are
  experiencing in the most general terms that they can identify such that one
  end of the either-or disjunction is a value and the other is an opposing fear.

A person identifies a present "either or" value crisis that they are experiencing in the most general terms that they can identify such that one end of the either-or disjunction is a value and the other is an opposing fear. For example:

"being subject to prohibitions and duties" (fear) vs. **"self-determination" (hope)**

They then choose the option that represents the hope:.

**"self-determination" (hope)**

They then identify the first fear that they immediately envision confronting them upon choosing to embrace the previously selected hope. In this case, the person may say that choosing self-determination leads immediately to:

"guilt for not living up to expectations of loved ones" (fear)

Continuing this process, they then take this fear and create a new disjunction between it and a new hope that immediately counters it directly and perfectly according to their own assessment. The new hope need not be morally permissible, but must represent the hope that the person actually values in immediate contrast to the adduced fear. For example:

"guilt for not living up to expectations of loved ones" (fear) vs.**"never again entertaining guilt" (hope)**

This process is then continued indefinitely. For example, if the person chooses "never again entertaining guilt" (hope), then they may say that the next fear to confront them if they were to enact that hope is:

"social isolation because of selfishness or perceived selfishness" (fear)

This fear would then be confronted with its immediately contrasting new hope as was done previously. For example:

"social isolation because of selfishness or perceived selfishness (fear)" vs. **"generosity towards the heart of the beloved whomever they happen to be" (hope)**

And so on, and so on.

Remarkably, it turns out that whenever this test is done, regardless of the value/fear alternatives one starts with, it results in a cyclical pattern. After a few steps, there is an endless loop of those same steps that just starts at the beginning again.

Below are four instances of real tests of this. The chosen hopes are in**bold text.**

1. **Frank **  
Being subject to prohibitions and duties - **Self-determination  
**Guilt for not living up to expectations - **Never again entertaining guilt  
**Social isolation - **Generosity towards the heart of the beloved  
**Fear of inadequacy in your eyes - **Radical confidence in my beauty  
**Fear of being misunderstood - **Focus on the needs of the other instead of myself  
**Fear of appearing pretentious - **Allegiance to truth that is sure  
**Having recourse to manipulation - **Love never fails  
**Perfect angel (not really me/self-betrayal) - **Honest recognition that I will fail to love perfectly  
**Discouragement treadmill - **Self-determination**

1. **Mike \[Catholic\]**  
Fear of****disapproval from others - **Speaking my mind **

Being persecuted for speaking out. - **Forgetting about respect, and worrying about justice (speaking my mind)**

1. **Tracy **  
Always insulting myself - **Not doing so (though I can't conceive of it)  
**Even if I could stop insulting myself, the judgments are true anyway **-  It would be better if the judgments were false  
**Even if I believe they are false, I fear that somebody trustworthy will articulate these judgments anyway **- It would be much better if somebody trustworthy were to say that they are false.  
**I feel like an idiot for not being able to correspond to/believe the assertion that they are false**-I do correspond to/ believe the assertion  
**I feel like an idiot for needing the reassurance**- I want the other person to have been important  
**I feel like I'm not important (worth their time, a bother, ugly etc.)**- Simple gratitude  
**The beloved sees me as defective - **The beloved sees me as undiminished  
**I am afraid that they are saying something false - **I am able to believe them  
**Fear of letting them down for real **- Believing that I have what it takes  
**Surprise! You don't! because you screwed up!**- Self-knowledge of factors in advance  
**Knowing my inability and fallibility in areas I value (inner ugliness) **- Not having it be there  
**But, lo, it really is there - **Not looking so as to not see  
**I am half aware that I am deceiving myself**- I suspend the little awareness I have  
**I fear that others will see me**- I am able to hide successfully  
**I feel contempt for others for being fooled **- I am able to not care about them either way  
**I fear becoming a sociopath (because that is a form of defect) - **I at least am able to embrace being a strong and able hater of others and myself   
**I am conflicted about that because it is evil, and I want to love - **I relieve the tension by holding open as a real possibility the idea of suicide  
**Holding it open, by nature, means I fail either way (cowardly to do and cowardly not to do) - **Taking it off the table because it doesn't work to hold it open  
**Everything is pointless, empty, and meaningless. - **I choose to kill evaluative faculties so that I do not see the pointlessness as such  
**I still have to interact with people - **People leave me alone  
**When I am alone, I am just stuck with my self-hate - **At least I have a place to focus it (on myself)**

1. **Tracy \[2\]**  
Being at the mercy of my environment - **Wanting to control my circumstances**
