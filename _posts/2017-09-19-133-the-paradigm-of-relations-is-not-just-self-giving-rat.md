  133. The paradigm of relations is not just self-­giving. Rather, it is
  self-­giving/self­-recovery.  134. Because you are what you give. And you also
  are what you receive.  135. Reciprocity ensures that you "receive" that which
  you "withhold" in a proceeding.  136. Namely, if you go in with a defense, you
  get injured by lack that comes back to you through the other person.  137. The
  injury pertains to "self­-recovery". Since the thing that went out had a wart,
  the wart comes back.  138. The gift/recovery cycle is metaphysically integral
  to every proceeding.  139. The only way to get what you “want” is by becoming
  all gift.  140. You get the opposite of what you want until you are all gift. 
  141. You always have to get what you give. And it seems that we can only give
  that which we have.  142. In a metaphysical non­-defense, we receive the other
  as gift even though their gift is behind a grab.  143. And this is only
  possible to do through the redemption, which cancels diminishment. If there is
  diminishment to be had, then it can't be done.  144. It becomes a defense in
  the trying.  145. So, if we are secularists, then the power of hope can be
  enough. It's the same reality.  146. The martyrdom of receiving the other is
  such that their wounds are not reflected back on them.  147. They receive in
  return for their broken offering a healed self.  148. And this is the
  conversion of hearts.  149. Psychology is a lot of guesswork interspersed with
  a few tried and tested principles. And, basically, it comes down to having
  someone to listen to you.  150. If we receive our proceeding as a gift, then
  it is.  151. Believe so, because to believe otherwise is to despair.  152. We
  don't see it that way because we have lost faith. Faith not in an ideology,
  but in hope and love.  153. And these lacunae in faith are the cause of our
  blindness to what we are being offered continually.  154. We've replaced faith
  with cunning, and received the accusation "You idiot" thereby.  155. The New
  Pentecost is tied into Therese's doctrine of the Little Way, which is also the
  same as Divine Chastity, which is the solution to the problem of evil. And the
  New Pentecost is the means of manifesting the charisms to combat evil in the
  real world.... (which is the solution to the problem of evil).  156. This is
  what heaven is about: It's not merely about dealing with adversity but about
  transcending adversity.  157. The transcendence of adversity is such that
  adversity is abolished.  158. It is not a recovery from diminishment, which
  would (at best), be redressing a deficit.  159. It is not merely a "how to
  integrate and make it less bad".  160. It would be contrary to God's good name
  as gift if it were about acting from a deficit.  161. This is not a matter of
  the "healing" of a wound, but of the glorification of the wound.  162. It is
  the annihilation of the power of the wound to logically possibly wound.  163.
  This is why Christ has come in the flesh.  164. Had the world simply been
  corrected and bandaged from its injuries, then diminishment would win forever.
  Even if the wounds were healed, all proceeds from a failure.  165. When you
  start with diminishment, you end with diminishment.  166. He came so that
  there would no longer be such a thing, but so that all would be transfigured
  to gift.  167. The glory of the resurrected Christ is all there is, even if we
  cannot see it yet.  168. Thus our persecutors have no power to harm us, though
  they curse us and kill the body.  169. They are our recompense.  170. And we
  offer their beauty back to them when we receive it.
