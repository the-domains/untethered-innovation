Despite there being the \*material\* P/non-P complementarity in
any real action between persons, in hard fact (since there cannot be any
contradiction in reality), the logical-relational space negation/non-negation
aspect of any interpersonal state of affairs need not follow suit. There can be
competing mutually exclusive claims on reality and one another. There can be
demands, in other words.

The complementarity of P and non-P, when it comes to persons and
the logical-relational-psychological space between them, is a matter of
non-negation/non-intersection, relationally-intentionally. It is an actively
willed relational form.

In the act of (actively) "letting be" and
"receiving-as-is", the perfect complementarity of P/non-P obtains
which "lets all things be properly themselves", no competing claims
contravening.

This relational non-negation/receptivity is the
logical-relational form of "gift" action.

With this, we can prove that gift obtains, metaphysically, in
any and every situation whatsoever, including the situation in which no
contingent properties are exemplified at all, and we can therefore conclude to
the nature of ultimate reality being gift.

To wit:

x is situationally necessary, iff x obtains in every contingency
(i.e. in every situation) whatsoever.

1) If it is not the case that x is situationally necessary, then
it is not the case that x is compatible with all contingencies. \[That is, if x
is not situationally necessary, there is some situation (some logical slice of
reality, actual or possible, however narrow or broad), from which x is
excluded.\]

2) Therefore, if x is compatible with all contingencies, then x
is situationally necessary. \[from 1, by Contraposition\]

As the formal quintessence of in-action integrality between P
and non-P, gift action is compatible with all contingencies whatsoever (since
any given property, entity, or situation is P or non-P).

Therefore God exists, and God is love.

"...the fundamental act of freedom is 'letting be' the
letting be of the being-given of myself to myself by God and others---the letting
be of the effectiveness of God and others in me that originally constitutes my
being as a gift that itself gives. My freedom at its core and thus in each of
its acts actively-receptively recollects my being-given as gift and thus as apt
for gift- giving (cf. Benedict's discussion of anamnesis): it recuperates the
relation to God and others in which I find myself always already a participant
and of which, consequently, I am never first or simply the origin." (David
L. Schindler, THE EMBODIED PERSON AS GIFT AND THE CULTURAL TASK IN AMERICA:
STATUS QUAESTIONIS)
