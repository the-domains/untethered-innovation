- We do not know how to love as we ought, which is to love perfectly, but we do know that we ought to love perfectly.

- When we try to love well, we necessarily fear not loving well. We cannot love by trying to love, because the trying enshrines the fear of not succeeding.

- But the one who fears is not yet perfect in love. Perfect love casts out all fear. If love is perfect, then fear is cast out. Trying to love can never possibly attain its aim, because the act of trying entails making fear our limit.

- Truly, if we regard our trying as valuable and effective, it doubly enshrines our fear of not trying.

- If we regard our trying as not valuable, not effective, then our act of trying is itself the object of our fear.

- We do not quite know what love is, not well enough to say it, to do-it-and-know-it's-done, to teach it. And not perfectly, if we do it, and if we did it perfectly, we don't know it truly. And what is love if love is not true love, true to itself, known to itself as itself, doing what it does, and doing it always, all ways?

- If we don't know it, how can we do it? If we don't know it to do it, how can we possibly teach it? The blind leading the blind is not what the blind want to do or be done in by.

- Be that as it may, our unknowing, our fear, our blindness does not prevent us from attaining perfect love. On the contrary, it is the infallible path to all perfection if only we follow it in diligence and blind obedience.

- Though we do not know love, we surely do know fear. We know fear when we see it, even if we do not know love when we see it.

- We know there is no fear in love. Therefore, in knowing fear, we thereby know, perfectly, what to act upon and how. Namely, "that" and "do not act upon it". Rather than striving for perfect love, namely that which is logically unattainable in the trying, we can instead act to eschew fear when we freely can.

- Fear of censure, fear of consequences, fear of misunderstanding, fear of inadequacy, fear of losing safety, fear of weakness, fear of excellence, fear of wealth, fear of poverty, fear of disappointing others, fear of being a disappointment to oneself - all of these are to be refused as "ways of acting" in whatever degree we can consciously freely evict such motives from ourselves.

- We will, of course harbor fears we do not know. Unknown fears. However, these are knowable as the fear of fear-unknown. We can freely reject the known fear of fear-unknown, since it is always and only one thing, one fear, regardless of what it contains elsewise.

- And whatever we cannot see and forsake, when we get tired of watching and knowing and doing everything right, we will embrace freely our actuality, as it is, without fear of having missed the mark in doing so.

- If there is any possibility of any legitimate hope whatsoever, then we cannot possibly fail by uniting our will with his in that selfsame act in which he embraced freely our actuality, as it is, which we may reject, rejecting God to give honor to God.

- The stone rejected by the builders has become the Cornerstone, us and him, nothing can separate us, not rejection, nothing at all. Only that which makes contradiction its hope, by trying to grasp at that which cannot be attained by grasping, because a contradiction cannot be true.

- Brothers and sisters:   
Have among yourselves the same attitude   
that is also yours in Christ Jesus,   
Who, though he was in the form of God,   
did not regard equality with God   
something to be grasped.   
Rather, he emptied himself,   
taking the form of a slave,   
coming in human likeness;   
and, found human in appearance,   
he humbled himself,   
becoming obedient to death,   
even death on a cross.

- In doing all we can possibly do, freely (i.e., not in fear), we thereby cooperate in freeing ourselves from the fear of loving imperfectly. We free ourselves from fear as such.

- And this freedom from fear as such is logically identical to the perfection of grace within us, or the Unitive Way, as it's been known.

- To freely say "no" to that which would solicit us, or threaten us, or bribe us to compromise our freedom is all we have to do to love perfectly.

- The deliberate choice to freely refuse fear is a trying which can succeed in leading us to perfect love undiminished. It is everything we can possibly do to make way for the gift of that which we cannot possibly do or know or reach by anything other than perfect love itself being the one doing and knowing and reaching out to us in our poverty.

-Instead of grabbing to attain the impossible, we need merely forego our claim to all impossibility entirely, as a sacrifice of all that is incoherent. An offering of nothing at all, to receive absolutely all good things in return, and to receive the one from whom all good things come, and to be one with the one through whom all good things come, in order to do what he does for those who will let him.

-In doing so, we eo ipso/ipso facto restore our perfect love of reason (at the very least, which is all of it all) by renouncing the contradiction of laying claim to the impossible.

- Whatever is truly possible is actually possible, and whatever is actually possible is part of the actual, conditioned by and consistent with being itself. Indeed, the actual is actual, and whatever is actual is necessarily actual, once it is, and whatever is consistent with the actual is actual, and whatever is actual is consistent with the nessessary, and whatever is consistent with the necessary is necessary.

- Of course, whatever is necessary necessarily participates in the gift of God who is necessary being as such.

-And because the gift of God is irrevocable and absolute, this participation of ours is itself to the degree that nothing, no contradiction, obstructs.

-"Make yourself a capacity, and I will make myself a torrent."

-- Whatever is not impossible is possible, and in forsaking all that is impossible, then all that remains for us is purest possibility, pure potentiality, pure dynamism.

- Our mode of action to receive the perfection of love, to love perfectly as we ought, is now seen to be nothing more than a remission of all holdings which obstruct perfect love.

-Perfect love, which perfectly loves us, and wants us to receive all, necessarily freely does all to fill all our lack when no obstacle interposes.

- If it is not perfect love, we can possibly fear it. If we cannot possibly fear it, it is love perfect.

- Therefore, our method is this: if we can possibly fear it, we are to divest ourselves of what we can possibly let go (that is, to freely say "no" to that which would solicit us, or threaten us, or bribe us to compromise our freedom).

- We can let go of what we fear, but we cannot let go of love, not truly, not ever, not once it has been received, especially if we are still in fear. If we are still in fear, afraid, then to let go of what we love would leave us with only fear, and because we are afraid, we cannot choose the greater fear, therefore we cannot let go of any lesser love.

-No one has ever repented of love, but has only either completed the lesser love by rescinding all deals with fear to make way for the fullness of love, or has chosen to die in an incomplete love which makes fear its master, thus making pain eternal in making the avoidance of pain, namely fear, "all there is".

- Therefore, be not afraid. Fear not the security of relinquishing all fear and permitting perfect love to love us perfectly.

- If perfect love has its way, we are capacitated to love as we are loved, not because there is someone requiring of us that which we would otherwise wish to keep, but because we will not be satisfied unless we love as we are loved, and love wills that which is highest and best for us.

- My Beloved, love alone is enough to take care of itself, and us, and all of its interests, forgetting none at all, because perfect love cannot fail to love perfectly, and perfectly means "nothing can separate us".

-Indeed, nothing can. Only the contradiction, which is nothing. All else besides nothing is Christ.
